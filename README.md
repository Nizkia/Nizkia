**👋 Hi, I’m Nizkia Musawir**

💻 Software Development Student | Mobile App Developer | Flutter & Android | UI/UX Enthusiast


**🌟 About Me**

I’m a Software Development student at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) with a strong focus on mobile application development, UI/UX design, and Firebase-backed systems.
I build practical, impactful applications — many of them designed to improve student life, streamline campus processes, and solve real user problems.

My work includes:

🚀 FLEXA – A full-featured student service marketplace (Flutter + Firebase)
📦 SWOOSH – Pickup & delivery system for campus (Android + Firebase)
📘 STUDYO – A student note-sharing platform (Diploma project)
I love clean architecture, meaningful UI, and creating systems that feel good to use.
